    <h2>Entry</h2>
    <p>CRUD is an acronym that stands for CREATE, READ, UPDATE, and DELETE. In SQL Server, CRUD is represented by 4
        operations performed on the selected data against a specific SQL database: CREATE refers to inserting columns
        and values into the table</p>

    <h2>Entry</h2>
    <p>Because databases store information more efficiently
        Data types act as a constraint pretty much they secure the data's integrity VARCHAR is a variable length string
        data type, so it holds only the characters you assign to it. VARCHAR takes up 1 byte per character + 2 bytes to
        hold length information SQL is the programming language used to interface with relational databases.NoSQL is a
        class of DBMs that are non-relational and generally do not use SQL A query in a database is a request for
        information stored within a database management system (DBMS)</p>
